This domain have housed different types of sites over the years. It started out with a [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}  blog, but lately it has been just an empty placeholder.

## Hosting
I have been using a local company for both web and e-mail hosting for over a decade. Their e-mail service has started to fall behind on several areas, and also in security, not supporting MFA. I decided to move my mail to [Proton](https://proton.me/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and their Plus account with support for custom domains. I have also moved my DNS-services to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, and only had my web hosting left at my old provider.

This lead to the decision to move web hosting to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} instead which would allow me to cancel the current hosting service.

## Platform
When moving to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}  is usually the first choice due to the seamless integration. I decided to try that together with the theme [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}  (you may recognize that page) ðŸ˜œ.

Let's see how that works out, but so far, Jekyll seems to be a really nice way to host a blog-like site.
